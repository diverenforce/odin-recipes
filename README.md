# odin-recipes2

Currently as an initial beginning genesis of this project/repository, I will be 
demonstrating the most basic and simple html syntax, skills and what I have learned
through this project.

The current project will have 3 links on the home page each leading into a new
webpage with a recipe for a random recipe of food. 

Expect further css implementations and reworks.
